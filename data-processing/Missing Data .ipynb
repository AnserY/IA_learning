    "- [A Survey on Missing Data in Machine Learning](./papers/001.pdf): The survey provides an overview of the different approaches to handle missing data in machine learning algorithms. The paper discusses the types of missing data and their impact on the accuracy of machine learning models. The survey covers different approaches for handling missing data, including imputation methods, such as mean imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, and regression imputation, and methods that incorporate missingness indicators, such as multiple imputation, Bayesian methods, and maximum likelihood methods. Additionally, the paper also covers advanced techniques such as deep learning methods, which can handle missing data by using autoencoder-based imputation techniques, and transfer learning methods, which use knowledge from related datasets to impute missing values. The survey also discusses the challenges of handling missing data in machine learning, such as selecting the appropriate imputation method for the specific dataset and the impact of imputation on the interpretability of the model. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for future research in this area. \n",
