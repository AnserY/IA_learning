    "- [A Systematic Review on Imbalanced Data Challenges\n",
    "in Machine Learning](./papers/002.pdf): study aimed at exploring the challenges associated with imbalanced data and the solutions to address these challenges in the context of machine learning. The review is based on a thorough examination of existing literature on the subject and focuses on a range of application areas where imbalanced data is a prevalent problem, such as healthcare, finance, and fraud detection. The study begins by defining imbalanced data and its impact on machine learning models, followed by an overview of the various methods used to address the problem, such as data preprocessing, algorithmic approaches, and cost-sensitive learning. The review then delves deeper into the specific challenges associated with imbalanced data in different application areas and the solutions proposed to overcome these challenges. In the healthcare domain, for instance, the review discusses the issue of imbalanced data in medical diagnosis and the approaches used to tackle it, such as ensemble learning and active learning. In the finance sector, the study explores the challenges of detecting fraudulent transactions with imbalanced data and the use of oversampling techniques to improve model performance. The review also considers the limitations and drawbacks of existing solutions and highlights the need for further research to address these issues. Finally, the study concludes with a discussion of the future direction of research in the field, emphasizing the importance of developing more robust and scalable solutions to address imbalanced data challenges in machine learning.\n"
