# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Learning Trace
This Git repository contains a learning trace of my journey in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). The purpose of this repository is to document my progress, keep track of the resources I have used. 

# Content 
The repository contains the following folder: 
- **01-foundations**: in this directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks designed to facilitate my learning of essential Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, as well as ML and DL frameworks like Scikit-learn and Pytorch.

- **02-paper implementations**:  using well-known Python frameworks and libraries, the most renowned scientific papers implemented in this folder. Papers are about computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.   

- **03-building makemore (Andrej Karpathy)**: this folder contains the Jupyter notebooks related to the Karpathy's cours related to [makemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&t=1763s)
